Real world examples must be your own and not based on the text or previous assignments.


1) In your own words, explain the benefits of normalization. Include a real-world
   scenario where normalization is necessary.

    Redundant elimination helps places like pharmacies and dispatchers. In a dispatching
    world you could have EMT and Police Officers all with different information.
    Each of them could be taking a different vehicle, paired with another person, and going
    to a different area. Based on where they go on the shift they could be staying in an area
    that was different from where they started. Also the potential of what they could be doing is
    different.

2) List and explain the different normal forms and how they relate to one another,
   with regard to your real-world scenario in the first question.

   Pharmacy scenario

    1NF - tables do not contain multiple values. If a patient has multiple medications,
    each would be listed separately.

    2NF - non-key attributes are dependent on the subset of the primary key and
    the table is 1NF compliant. The copay attribute has zero relation with the
    medication table. It has to do with patients insurance.

    3NF - the record must be 2NF compliant and transitive functional dependencies of
    non-prime attributes don't exist. Pharmacy's usually have a store attached. The
    only data they need is if a sale was completed or not. So when patient table has
    confirmed_pickup, payed_for should translate to true on the store_income table and
    patient_insurance table. The store should have nothing but the payed_for attribute.



3) This student_records table contains students and their grades in different subjects.
   The schema is already in first normal form (1NF). Convert this schema to the third
   normal form (3NF) using the techniques you learned in this checkpoint.




   CREATE TABLE student_records (
     "student_id"     	INTEGER,
     "student_email"  	VARCHAR(24),

4) In your own words, explain the potential disadvantages of normalizing the data
   above. What are its trade-offs? Submit your findings in the submission table and
   discuss them with your mentor in your next session.

    The time to complete is slower. In order to query the tables we must use
    join statements.


5) Looking at the tables you have normalized. If you need to denormalize to improve
   query performance or speed up reporting, how would you carry out denormalization
   for this database design? Submit potential strategies in the submission tab and
   discuss them with your mentor in your next session.

   In this table professors only teach one class. I would combine subjects to the
   professors table to get rid of that would be join statement to save time.


6) Explore the trade-offs between data normalization and denormalization in this
   scenario, submit your findings in the submission tab, and discuss them with your
   mentor in your next session.

    I would keep normalized data records in this scenario. The majority of data would
    remain the same for some time. With the offset of student_grades being a volatile
    variable. The landscape of a school would rather be able to maintain code than
    increasing performance as the sites database is mostly fixed.
