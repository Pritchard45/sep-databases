Use the commands we have learned about to complete the following tasks and submit the SQL statements in the submission tab.
Real world examples must be distinct from those used in the text.

1) List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data

  CREATE(TABLE), INSERT INTO(logs, quantities, VALUES, TIMESTAMP), UPDATE(SET, WHERE) DELETE(FROM, WHERE), ALTER TABLE (ADD COLUMN, DROP COLUMN,SET DEFAULT)

2) Explain the structure for each type of command.

    CREATE TABLE, takes what the table is called and then allows you to provide attributes(column names) which have data types attached to them.
      CREATE TABLE checkpoints (id integer, name text, complete boolean);

    INSERT INTO populates the table with values, it is important that the values are in the correct order. As if the type is the same no error will be thrown.
      INSERT INTO checkpoints VALUES (id, name, complete);

    UPDATE allows us to change data in a specific value in a row.
      UPDATE checkpoints SET complete=TRUE WHERE id = 1;

    DELETE removes data. This is irreversible.
      DELETE FROM checkpoints WHERE id=2;

    ALTER TABLE updates the whole table. Avoid if able.
      ALTER TABLE checkpoints ADD COLUMN content text SET DEFAULT 'WELCOME';

3) What are some the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real world example of each.

    My bank account balance is a money data type.
    My bio on Instagram is a text data type.
    The score of the past 3 weeks of football use an integer data type.

4) Think through how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding.
   This table needs to have first and last name, whether they sent in their RSVP,
   the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

     a) Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?

        First and last name. (text)
        Whether they sent in their RSVP. (boolean)
        Number of guests. (integer)
        Number of meals. [numeric(p, s)]

      b) Write a command that makes the table to track the wedding.

          CREATE TABLE wedding (
            first_name text,
            last_name text,
            rsvp boolean,
            guest integer,
            meals numeric(5, 2)
          );

      c) Using the table we just created, write a command that adds a column to track whether they were sent a thank you card.

              ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN card boolean;

      d) You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column
         storing the number meals from the wedding table.

              ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN meals;

      e) The guests are going to need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.

              ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN table integer;

      f) The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the wedding table from the database.

              DROP TABLE wedding;

5) Write a command to make a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies,
   and available copies.

      CREATE TABLE library (
        isbn integer,
        title text,
        author text,
        genre text,
        publishing_date date,
        copies integer,
        available_copies integer
      );

     a) Find three books and add their information to the table.

      INSERT INTO library (isbn, title, author, genre, publishing_date, copies, available_copies)

      VALUES
        (9781982770567, 'The Institute', 'Stephen King', 'contemporary fiction', 2019-09-01, 29012, 1342),
        (9780062080233, 'American Gods', 'Neil Gaiman', 'fiction', 2001-6-19, 203930, 4443),
        (9781422191651, 'Everything I Ever Needed To Know About Economics I Learned From Online Dating', 'Paul Oyer',
          'self-improvement', 2014-01-07, 239483, 50000);

     b) Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the available copies column to 1 fewer.

        UPDATE library SET available_copies=1341
          WHERE isbn=9781982770567;

     c) Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.

        DELETE FROM library WHERE isbn=9781422191651;

6) Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin,
   a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and approximate miles from Earth.

    CREATE TABLE spacecraft (
      id integer,
      name text,
      launch_year integer,
      country text,
      mission text,
      orbiting_location text,
      mission_active boolean,
      distance_from_earth float,
    );

  In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

     a) Add 3 non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.

        INSERT INTO spacecraft(id, name, launch_year, country, mission, orbiting_location, mission_active, distance_from_earth)

          (123, 'Stardust-NExT', 1999, 'USA', 'Comet investigating', 'Tempel 1', FALSE, (6.46 * 10^8) ),
          (34, 'Ulysses', 1990, 'USA', 'North and South Poles of the Sun', 'Sun', FALSE, (2.15 * 10^8) ),
          (213, 'Spitzer Space Telescope', '2003', 'USA', 'Early Universe pictures in infrared light', 'Universe', TRUE, (1.10 * 10^8) );

     b) Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just been crashed into the planet.

        DELETE FROM spacecraft WHERE id=213;

     c) Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.

        UPDATE spacecraft SET mission_active FALSE where id=123

7) Write a command to make a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender,
   any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not it’s been read, and the id of the email chain it’s in.

        CREATE TABLE inbox ( id integer, subject text, sender text, recipients text, body text, timestamp date, read boolean, chain_id integer);

   Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

     a) Add 3 new emails to the inbox.

        (1, 'Hello', 'thisisme@hi.com', 'brucewillis@diehard.com', 'Christmas Movie', 2002-11-13, FALSE, 17),
        (2, 'Good-bye', 'bye@bye.com', 'leo@hollywood.com', 'Hello Hello', 2019-9-13, TRUE, 27)
        (3, 'Maybe later', 'now@later.com', 'jolly@rancher.com', 'Snickers are better', 2009-2-14, TRUE, 37);


     b) You’ve just deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.

        DELETE FROM inbox WHERE id=2;

     c) You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating, so you can come back to it later.

        UPDATE inbox SET read=false WHERE id=1;
