    09/02/1945           - Date

    $15.99               - Float/ Money/ Smallmoney which are not supported by some database vendors.

2) Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

  Databases are needed when you need to add delete or change data. In an office setting and everyone has an email account
  databases are used to be able to easily add a new employee, delete an old employee or change something in a profile.
  Databases are most helpful when the majority of the data comes from users that have zero access to the source code.

  A text file might be used for written code, or data that does not need to be manipulated, added to as often. These
  are also readable by humans whereas databases are normally not readable.


3) Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

  SQL is a declarative language, while many other languages are procedural.


4) In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

  ***A database has parts. Each value of data belongs to a specific row and column. Each row and column  belong to a table.
     The columns have attributes that have certain data types attached to them. Only certain types of data can be entered into them.
     A row allows to find out where to look for specific data. Rows usually have a timestamp or an ID based on when a entry was created.

5) Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

  A table is the entire record-book.
  A column is the topic of the information held there.
  A row is all the singular information that correlates with one entry.
  The value is the information inside of a cell where a column and row intersect.


6) List 3 data types that can be used in a table.

  String
  Integer
  Float

7) Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

      '2016-05-15',   124.93
      '2016-05-23',   54.72

     SELECT amount        ***Collect the amount value from the payments table when the amount is greater than 500.
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;

      1500.00

     SELECT *             ***Collect all of the values from the row in the payments table where the payee is Mega Foods.
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

        "date",      "payee",     "amount", "memo"
       '2016-05-15', 'Mega Foods', 124.93,  'Groceries'

8) Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

    SELECT userid
    FROM users
    WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'

    All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

    SELECT *
    FROM users
