2) Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

  Databases are needed when you need to add delete or change data. In an office setting and everyone has an email account
  databases are used to be able to easily add a new employee, delete an old employee or change something in a profile.
  Databases are most helpful when the majority of the data comes from users that have zero access to the source code.

  A text file might be used for written code, or data that does not need to be manipulated, added to as often. These
  are also readable by humans whereas databases are normally not readable.


3) Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

  SQL is a declarative language, while many other languages are procedural.

  In a collection of Users, the users each have their email name and wether or not they are premium.
  The Users each have an ID(integer) which correlates to which profile is theirs. Then in the profile table they have NAME EMAIL and PREMIUM?.
  That table has a rows underneath these columns with their actually information in it.

7) Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

       '2016-05-15', 'Mega Foods', 124.93,  'Groceries'

8) Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

    The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

    SELECT email, signup
    FROM users
    WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data'

    The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

    SELECT userid
    FROM users
    WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'

    All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

    SELECT *
    FROM users
    WHERE userid = 4
